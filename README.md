# Fast Line Follower Robot with EDF

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a fast line follower robot equipped with an Electronic Differential Drive (EDF). The robot is designed to autonomously follow a line on the ground using infrared sensors and achieve high-speed performance.

## Features

- **Electronic Differential Drive (EDF):** The robot uses an EDF system for precise control and maneuverability.
- **High-Speed Line Following:** Optimized algorithms enable the robot to follow lines at high speeds.
- **Infrared Sensors:** Line tracking is achieved through infrared sensors that detect the contrast between the line and the surrounding surface.
- **Modular Architecture:** The code is organized into modular components for easy customization and maintenance.

## Hardware Requirements

- Robot chassis with EDF
- Infrared sensors array
- Motor drivers
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Power supply
- Wheels and motors

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Necessary libraries (provide links or installation instructions)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/line-follower-robot.git
   cd line-follower-robot
